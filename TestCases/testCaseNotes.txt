4 Files

<testname>.input - Input to provide to the Qwirkle program via stdin
<testname>.output - Expected output from the Qwirkle program on stdout
(Optional) <testname>.save - Input save file to provide to the Qwirkle program if required by the test.
(Optional) <testname>.expsave - Expected output saved game file.

A test is run using the following sequence of commands.

-./qwirkle < <testname>.input > <testname>.gameout

-diff -w <testname>.output <testname>.gameout

-if [-e <testname>.expsave] diff -w -y <testname>.expsave <actual_gamesave>


If this command displays any output, then the test has failed. Testing uses the diff command. This
command checks to see if two files have any differences. The -w options ignores any white-space.
To make testing reliable, you should note if the test evaluates the saved game output, then ensure the test uses
a suitable filename in place of <actual_gamesave>.

ASSUMPTIONS: 

The board will be 11 x 11 by default (though we can test for making a differently sized board)

If necessary, make a test class specifically for executing game logic acording to test instruction

STANDARD CASES:

enterNames - Test case for entering player names

EmptyBoard - Test Case for displaying an empty board

PlaceTile - Test Case for displaying board with a certain tile on it 

ReplaceTile - Test case for replacing a tile 
 
EndGameNoSpaces - Test case for filling in the last spot in a board. The game should end 

EndGameNoTiles - Test case for running out of tiles in the bag. The game should end.

scoreShapeQwirkle - Test case for getting a qwirkle of 6 shapes 

scoreColourQwirkle - Test case for getting a qwirkle of 6 colours

twoTurns - Test case for both players playing a turn

SaveLoadGame - Test case for saving and loading game 



ERROR CASES:

tileOutOfBounds - Test case for placing a tile out of bounds of the board
 
rowOverSix - Test case for more than 6 tiles in a row
